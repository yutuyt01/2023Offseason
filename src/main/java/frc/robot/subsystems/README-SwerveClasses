Wpilib documentation - the whole section on the left (barring the differential drive) is a good read for more insight into the classes used.
Essentially, the FRC library has a lot of tools that streamline the process of creating swerve drive code. 
It cuts out a lot of math that underlines how the fieldcentric swerve works (and that I didn't take the time to understand)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xi9yb1IMyA Zero to autonomous video that's a must watch.
Most of the swerve code is directly from this video. It's important though to understand how it all works.
