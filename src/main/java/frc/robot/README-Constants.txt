The constants.java file is a great practice that I unfortunately didn't consistently utilize all the way through this code.
Essentially, by importing the class Constants and subclass I want to use, I can put all my constants that may change in the future in.
Examples: Motor IDs, offsets, and anything that you think you might use twice in code. 
It's easier to change it in one place and have the values in code point to the same place!
